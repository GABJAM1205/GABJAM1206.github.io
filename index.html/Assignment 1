<h1>My background: </h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Gabriel Vorster. I speak English and was born in Oxford, 
England in 2003, I went to primary school up until 2012 when my family moved 
to Perth, Australia. I became an Australian citizen in 2017. After primary 
school I decided to become home-schooled. In 2018 I enrolled for Acts2Come 
Bible College and received a Certificate III in ‘Catholic Youth Ministry and
Leadership’. At the start of this year, I enrolled with OUA and studied 
‘Introduction to Programming’ and ‘Art and Design Fundamentals’. I passed both
courses and am now enrolled in two new OUA courses; ‘Introduction to Information
Technology’ and ‘Game Art and Design’. An interesting fact about me, is that I 
work as a voluntary student leader at a youth group 2 days a week. I love to play
video games and hang out with my friends.</p>

<h2>What is your Interest in IT? </h2>
<p>My interest in IT is inspired by the amazing technology that has been developed
over the years. Humanity has produced outstanding devices from the ‘smart phone’ to
8K televisions. I would say that my interest in IT started informally when I entered
the HMV Store in Oxford, UK to purchase our family’s first Wii.  The wonder of gaming
was a revelation.  Formally, I was able to actively pursue my interest at the 
beginning of 2017 when I took some courses in game design.  The opportunity to be 
creative, see design at work and actually start gathering the knowledge and skills
needed to create virtual experiences was like a dream for me. IT is a bridge to 
technological advancements and creations; it is going to be a massive part of our future.</p>

<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h2>
<p>At the start of the year I wanted to expand my knowledge of interest areas, I 
started with OUA and picked two subjects that related to my interests; creativity(art) 
and computers(programming). One of the courses that I picked was with RMIT, I studied 
with RMIT in the first semester of 2019 and at the end of the semester I obtained an HD
in programming. I wanted to continue further down the path of technology but wished to 
try something different, so I enrolled for Introduction to Information technology at 
RMIT.</p>

<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h2>
<p>I wish to use this course as a foundation to explore the vast range of careers 
within the IT field. I am particularly interested in game design so Intro to IT 
will be very beneficial for my future learning and development.</p>

<h2>Free online learning style test Results:</h2>
<p>Your Scores:
•	Auditory: 15%
•	Visual: 55%
•	Tactile: 30%
You are a Visual learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.
Visual
If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember
things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using
methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your 
eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to 
watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions 
and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to 
spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.
Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
•	Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)
•	Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.
•	Use flashcards to learn new words.
•	Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.
•	Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.
•	Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.
•	Color code things.
•	Avoid distractions during study times.
Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.

<h2>Online creativity test: </h2>
<p>Your creativity score: 110 out of 200 pts.00 pts.
You know how to think creatively but you can become even more creative. 
Start by not judging your ideas. All ideas are good ideas. Sometimes 
the best ideas are the hardest to understand.
.</p>

<h1>My thoughts on the results: </h1>
<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h2>
<p>The results of each of these tests reveal; firstly, that I am spontaneous, open minded, 
warm, expressive and detailed oriented. I find these results to be accurate and I feel that 
they describe my personality quite well. Secondly, I am a visual learner. I learn better 
through visual media rather than that presented in a tactile or auditory manner. I do agree 
with these results, but I think that a person should have a balanced approach to learning. 
I hope that I am able to boost my other learning styles, so I am able to receive information 
in a variety of ways. Thirdly, my creativity level is just above average. I like to be 
creative and come up with new ideas, but I see that to establish those ideas I need to put 
more time and effort into them.</p>

<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h2>
<p>These results give me confidence for working in a team environment. The results show 
that I am open minded and flexible. This enables me to adapt, be open to new ideas or 
change direction if needed. Knowing that I am a visual learner means I would convey my 
ideas visually, for example, visual content would be easier for me to create and express. 
In order to come up with new ideas and solutions I will need to work on my creativity 
level as reflected  in the test results. Overall, I think that I am able to work 
efficiently in a team and will endeavour to develop my skills as I develop my project 
experience.	</p>

<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h2>
<p>In a team it is important to be able to negotiate your ideas and thoughts, communication
with team members is essential. When forming a team, I would look for team members who are 
good at communication and can provide ideas in a context I can understand. I would also 
look for others who have strengths and skills I lack so that we can collaborate more broadly.
Looking for team members with creativity experience could also be very beneficial for our team`s 
development.

<h1>IT project: </h1>
<h2>Overview: </h2>
<p>The project idea is a concept for a superhero video game. The games current title is, ‘skin changer’.
The age demographic for this game is mainly aimed at older teenagers. This is more of a casual game 
played mainly for experience and aesthetic. This is a futuristic superhero game in which the main 
character of the game has undergone genetic experiments which have given him powers to change into 
different animals. The player must free the city from the dictator-like government. The feel of the 
game will be quite mysterious and have a futuristic vibe, combining both natural and manmade structures. 
Obstacles to consider would involve projects, such as; start-up funding, resourcing the best team, 
launching the product onto the market.  </p>

<h2>Motivation: </h2>
<p>Customers will be drawn to this superhero game because of its compelling genre and immersive, hands on 
game play. One of the most amazing (and successful) superhero franchises; Marvel Studios, has produced 
some of the most stunning action and adventure films ever “…The superhero game industry could be big 
business for game developers. Stats put together by https://www.boxofficemojo.com reveal that the 
Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is made up of superheroes such as Iron Man, Thor, and Captain Marvel, 
has made more than $21 billion at the global box office in total…” (Wallace, 2019.)  Those who love 
action and superhero movies will love this game. The ability to shape-shift into different forms opens 
doors to endless gameplay mechanics. This game gives the player freedom to explore the large over-world of 
chaos and mystery as a variety of wild animals. This game will also have a in depth narrative with story-based 
levels, you will gradually discover your many abilities as you progress through the story.</p>

<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>This game takes place in the year 2115 in the sprawling city of Spero. Human society is controlled by the 
powerful government Imperius, humanity is going through the Second scientific revolution. The city of Spero 
is very futuristic, it is filled with skyscrapers; the tallest one being Imperium. The Environment will be 
quite stunning and have lots of lighting and futuristic vehicles. The over world will be comparative to the 
island of Manhattan.</p>

<p>For military purposes, Imperius is experimenting with IGM (immediate genetic modification) to see if they 
can create a formula that adds extra genes from multiple animals to empower the abilities of man. Ryan Li is 
invited to the Try Athlon which is hosted by the Imperius. He wins second place and later that day he is 
kidnapped. He wakes up in an Imperius laboratory, Doctor Schmitz, the Head of IGM informs him that he has 
undergone genetic experimentation after which he was placed in a hyper-sleep pod in order for his body to 
be altered by the IGM process. It is now 2190! The doctor explains that the Try Athlon was used to find a 
suitable candidate for the experiment, Ryan is now going to be ‘discarded’ because the Imperius knows the 
process was successful. He is locked in a cell and in his rage turns into a rhinoceros and starts smashing 
the cell walls. He breaks free from the laboratory and begins to stampede through the city. When doctor 
Schmitz finds out that Ryan has broken free, he is infuriated. The Doctor intended for the shapeshifting 
abilities to activate after five hours. Doctor Schmitz discovers that an employee accidentally miscalculated 
the time the abilities would activate. </p>

<p>Throughout the game the player explores the city and gains different animal forms and abilities. 
This is a list of the animals that the player is able to transform into: a lion, rhinoceros, gorilla, 
crocodile, cheetah, otter and eagle. The lion is great at combat and is best for battling enemies. The 
Rhino is able to ram walls or blocked areas. The Gorilla enables the player to climb and access higher 
areas. The Crocodile is able to swim very fast in bodies of water or sewers. The Cheetah is incredibly 
fast on land and is best for travelling to places. The Otter can travel through small areas like 
ventilation shafts. Finally, the Eagle can fly from location to location. </p>

<p>The game will also include challenging enemies; such as crooks and imperials. You can take on these 
enemies using your animal abilities. The game will have cut scenes which help to convey the game’s story. 
There will also be an in-game menu from which you will be able to learn new abilities as you gather 
gaming experience. You gain experience from completing side quests and defeating enemies. The game will 
include violence but no gore, similar to that of the Star Wars Battlefront series. The game will also 
feature a mini map in order to determine your location in the overworld. </p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies: </h2>
<p>In order to create this game, game development software such as Unity is required. Unity is a great 
tool for creating and installing different assets, such as; audio, textures, UI and more. This game 
is created to provide the user with a thrilling, adventurous, action orientated experience, so I 
believe the best platform for this game will be PC or PS4.  Java is a good programming language to 
use for this project and an application such as eclipse would be highly beneficial. I would also 
really like to create some concept art for this game, I will be using Adobe photoshop to do so. 
Modelling tools will be required, such as Maya.</p>

<h2>Skills Required: g</h2>
<p>There are many skills required for this game as it is an ambitious project. People who have experience
with programming are needed, especially those with expertise using java. We will use 3D modelling skills 
to create characters, props and other in-game objects. Level designers and world designers are some of 
the most important roles, the game depends on stunning environment and challenging levels. Art and 
textures will be managed by concept artists and texture artists. Cutscenes and combat require a great 
amount of animation work, so the project must employ experienced animators. It is expected that everyone
who takes part in the creation and distribution of this game will have strong communication skills, 
it is very important that we are able to cooperate with each other and convey the video game to the 
public. Project management and leadership skills will underpin this project.</p>

<h2>Outcome: </h2>
<p>The outcome of this project will be determined by the success in reviews received and sales of the product. 
Our goal is to bring a thrilling and action-packed game to our target audience (older teenagers) and convey 
the experience of being a superhero. We will solve this problem through excellent design and production, 
marketing and distribution. We hope that this novel concept game will give a unique experience to each 
customer, as it provides freedom to take on the form of an amazing superhero and explore a dynamic, 
futuristic game world.  </p>
